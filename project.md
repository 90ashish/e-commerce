1. Project Idea: Event-Driven E-Commerce Order Processing

Build a mini “Amazon-style” order pipeline composed of three Go microservices communicating exclusively via Kafka:

    Order Service (Producer)

        Exposes a REST endpoint to create orders.

        Publishes an orders.created event with order payload.

    Inventory Service (Consumer → Producer)

        Subscribes to orders.created.

        Checks/updates stock (in-memory or simple DB).

        Publishes inventory.reserved or inventory.failed.

    Notification Service (Consumer)

        Listens on both topics.

        Sends “order confirmed” or “out of stock” notifications (log or email stub).

2. Kafka Features You’ll Master

    Topic partitioning & keying: Ensure orders from the same user always hit the same partition.

    Consumer groups: Scale out multiple inventory or notification instances.

    Offset management: Commit on success/failure handlers.

    Exactly-once semantics (optional): Use Kafka transactions so you never double-reserve stock.

    Schema evolution: Integrate Confluent Schema Registry to version your order payloads.

3. Golang Tooling

    Client libraries:

        segmentio/kafka-go – idiomatic Go API

        Shopify/sarama – advanced features (transactions, interceptors)

    Configuration: Externalize brokers, topics, group IDs via Viper or environment variables.

    Graceful shutdown: Use context.Context + signal handling to flush offsets and close connections.

4. Extensions for Deeper Learning

    Stream processing: Implement a Go app that aggregates order volume per minute and writes to a “metrics” topic.

    Kafka Connect: Sink your events to MongoDB or PostgreSQL without writing code.

    Monitoring: Hook up Prometheus exporters for consumer lag, broker health.

    Idempotency & Retries: Design your services to safely retry on transient failures.

This single project surfaces producers, consumers, partitions, offset commits, error handling, schema management and—if you opt in—transactions. You’ll come away with a rock-solid grasp of Kafka in a real-world Go microservices context.
